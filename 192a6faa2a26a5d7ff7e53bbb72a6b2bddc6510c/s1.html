                            Nowadays, cybercriminals are becoming increasingly hooked 
                            on big game hunting. Public institutions ranging from 
                            educational facilities to governmental agencies seem to be 
                            their favorite targets. One of the most notable instances 
                            of the latter in recent history was the Baltimore ransomware attack.

                            Baltimore had been targeted by ransomware once prior to the May 
                            2019 attack in 2018, though that attack was smaller in comparison 
                            and took down the city's emergency dispatch system for a short duration.

                    <h2>Baltimore Held Hostage: How it happened?</h2>
                    <p class="pad_bot2">
                        On May 7, 2019, the city of Baltimore, Maryland, was hit by a ransomware 
                        attack that affected most of the city's online services. The attackerstook 
                        control of a majority of the city's servers and put forward a ransom 
                        demand of 13 bitcoins to unlockthem. This worldwide WannaCry ransomware 
                        used the EternalBlue cyber attack exploit developed by the National Security 
                        Agency (NSA). A vulnerability of Windows OS was discovered much earlier but 
                        NSA decided not to report to Microsoft but developed a cyber attack exploit 
                        based on this vulnerability according to testimony by former NSA employees. 
                        Microsoft released patches in March 2017 but there were still huge number of 
                        unpatched computers worldwide and the cyber attack continueduntil recently.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pad_bot2">
                        Baltimore was susceptible to such an attack due to its IT practices, which 
                        included decentralized control of its technology budget and a failure to 
                        allocate money its information security manager wanted to fund cyberattack 
                        insurance. The attack has been compared to a ransomware attack on 
                        Atlanta the previous year, and was the second major use of the RobbinHood 
                        ransomware on an American city in 2019, as Greenville, North Carolina was 
                        also affected in April.

                    <p class="pad_bot2">
                        <br>The WannaCry ransomware attack spread through the Internet, using an exploit 
                        vector named EternalBlue, which was allegedly leaked from the U.S. National 
                        Security Agency. The ransomware attack, unprecedented in scale, infected more 
                        than 230,000 computers in over 150 countries, using 20 different languages 
                        to demand money from users using Bitcoin cryptocurrency. WannaCry demanded US$300 
                        per computer. The attack affected Telefónica and several other large companies 
                        in Spain, as well as parts of the British National Health Service (NHS), where 
                        at least 16 hospitals had to turn away patients or cancel scheduled operations,
                        FedEx, Deutsche Bahn, Honda, Renault, as well as the Russian Interior 
                        Ministry and Russian telecom MegaFon. The attackers gave their victims a 
                        7-day deadline from the day their computers got infected, after which the encrypted 
                        files would be deleted.
                    </p>                    
                    <p class="pad_bot2">
                        The attack had a negative impact on the real estate market as property transfers 
                        could not be completed digitally due to the system being down, as the 
                        city's card payment system and debt checking application were rendered 
                        inaccessible. In addition, city employees were unable to use their email system 
                        and resorted to creating Gmail accounts as workaround. Google automatically 
                        blocked their accounts at first due to the large number of accounts created 
                        in that timespan, though the company later restored the Gmail accounts.

                    <p class="pad_bot2">
                        The recovery, initially estimated to take several more weeks on May 20, 
                        ultimately lasted until September. Frank Johnson, Baltimore's IT 
                        director, was put on unpaid leave following the ransomware attack. Since 
                        becoming the city's IT director during the Pugh administration, Johnson 
                        had been criticized for not having a written disaster recovery plan and 
                        for his handling of the 2019 attack, which was estimated to cost the city 
                        $18 million. He was replaced by deputy director Todd Carter, who later 
                        became the permanent IT director in February 2020 after Johnson left the role in October.

                    <h2>What is WannaCry you might ask?</h2>
                    <p class="pad_bot2">
                        WannaCry exploits a vulnerability in Windows SMBv1 (Server Message Block), 
                        which allows "\remote code execution". After infecting a vulnerable Windows 
                        system, it encrypts files and demands payment in exchange for decrypting 
                        the files. More specifically, SMB is a network communication 
                        protocol for providing shared access to files and printers among computers 
                        on a network. However, Microsoft's implementation of the protocol has several 
                        security vulnerabilities and allows them to execute arbitrary code on the target 
                        computer. This vulnerability can be a result of the well-known buffer overflow attack.
                    </p>

                    <p class="pad_bot2">
                        The SMB vulnerability - labelled as CVE-2017-0143 and CVE-2017-0144 in two 
                        slightly different forms—appears to have first been discovered by the 
                        NSA sometime before 2016, though the NSA has never publicly admitted to 
                        having used it; it wouldn't be tied to the agency until it leaked in 2017, 
                        revealing its integration in NSA tools called <strong>EternalBlue</strong>, EternalRomance, 
                        and EternalSynergy.
                    </p>
                    <p class="pad_bot2">
                        The SMB zero-day no doubt represented a kind of precious specimen for the 
                        agency's spies: Microsoft's SMB feature allows the sharing of files between 
                        PCs. But the agency's researchers found that it could be tricked into 
                        confusing harmless data with executable commands that an attacker injected 
                        via SMB into a computer's memory. That made it a rare entry point that the 
                        NSA's hackers could use to run their own code on practically any Windows 
                        machine with no interaction from the target user, and one that offered access 
                        to the computer's kernel, the deepest part of its operating system. "It's 
                        exactly the kind of vulnerability someone would want," Chien says. "The target 
                        doesn't have to open a document or visit a website. You have a machine on the 
                        internet, and I can get you with it. I immediately have the highest privileges available to me."
                    </p>

                    <h2>What is EternalBlue?</h2>
                    <p class="pad_bot2">
                        The EternalBlue flaw has been implicated in a range of cyber-attacks over the 
                        past three years, including the WannaCry assault that disrupted the UK's NHS.
                        It involves a bug in old versions of Microsoft's Windows operating system 
                        that allows other malicious code to be run on infected computers.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The NSA reportedly created a tool to do this, which it also called <b>EternalBlue</b>.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The New York Times said the agency did not disclose the problem to Microsoft 
                        for more than five years until a breach forced its hand.
                        Microsoft released a fix for EternalBlue flaw in March 2017.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Weeks later, a group calling itself the Shadow Brokers leaked the NSA's 
                        related hacking tool online.
                        The NSA has never confirmed how it came to lose control of its code nor 
                        officially commented on the affair.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        But the suggestion is that if it had shared its findings with Microsoft 
                        at an earlier stage, fewer PCs would have been exposed to subsequent attacks 
                        that made use of the vulnerability.

                    <h2>What Is a Ransomware Attack and What's Next?</h2>
                    <p>
                        Ransomware is a form of malware designed to encrypt files on a 
                        device, rendering any files and the systems that rely on them 
                        unusable. Malicious actors then demand ransom in exchange for 
                        decryption. In recent years, ransomware incidents have become 
                        increasingly prevalent among the Nation's state, local, tribal, 
                        and territorial (SLTT) government entities and critical infrastructure organizations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Ransomware incidents can severely impact business processes and 
                        leave organizations without the data they need to operate and 
                        deliver mission-critical services. Malicious actors have adjusted 
                        their ransomware tactics over time to include pressuring victims 
                        for payment by threatening to release stolen data if they refuse 
                        to pay and publicly naming and shaming victims as secondary forms 
                        of extortion. The monetary value of ransom demands has also increased, 
                        with some demands exceeding US $1 million. Ransomware incidents have 
                        become more destructive and impactful in nature and scope. Malicious 
                        actors engage in lateral movement to target critical data and propagate 
                        ransomware across entire networks. These actors also increasingly use 
                        tactics, such as deleting system backups, that make restoration and 
                        recovery more difficult or infeasible for impacted organizations. 
                        The economic and reputational impacts of ransomware incidents, 
                        throughout the initial disruption and, at times, extended recovery, 
                        have also proven challenging for organizations large and small.

                        On September 30, 2020, a joint Ransomware Guide was released, which 
                        is a customer centered, one-stop resource with best practices and 
                        ways to prevent, protect and/or respond to a ransomware attack. CISA 
                        and MS-ISAC are distributing this guide to inform and enhance network 
                        defense and reduce exposure to a ransomware attack.

                        Ransomware attacks are typically carried out using a Trojan disguised as a legitimate file that the user is tricked into downloading or opening when it arrives as an email attachment. However, one high-profile example, the WannaCry worm, traveled automatically between computers without user interaction.

                        The requirements for cybersecurity can vary widely from organization 
                        to organization. A role that can be extremely relevant to a specific 
                        business may not make sense for a smaller company or even a larger 
                        one but that works in another segment.
